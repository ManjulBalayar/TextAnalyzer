"""
In this file, I work with perform data preprocessing using popular ML libraries (unlike the other ones which were rule-based) and I also work with BERT
to capture the files/texts semantics. Will do similar things such as understanding the sentiment of the text like regex and compare those two, topic classfication,
and finally a summarization which rule-based cannot do.
